### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nikos. I am a Naval Architect and Marine Engineer! 
![Profile views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/Jakendarth) 

I graduated from the National Technical University of Athens and now I am working towards my PhD at TU Delft. This is my personal Github page where you can find some of my projects. I really enjoy programming and I hope I will be able to aid in unifying my discipline with well documented and easily accessible Software.
