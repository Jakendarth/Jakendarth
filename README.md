![I am a Naval Architect and Marine Engineer ](https://github.com/Jakendarth/Jakendarth/blob/main/banner.png)

I graduated from the National Technical University of Athens and now I am working towards my PhD at TU Delft. This is my personal Github page where you can find some of my projects. I really enjoy programming and I hope I will be able to aid in unifying my Discipline with well documented and easily accessible Software.

Skills: MATLAB/C++/ Python / JS / HTML / CSS
